Bus/BusConfiguration questions
=====================================
PublicationTimeout in BusConfiguration - Is this only applicable to sync?
what is ConsumerMessagePrefetchCount in BusConfiguration for?
what is ConsumerDequeueTimeout for?

could you have two different ctors for the bus?
 - BusConfigurationPublisher
 - BusConfigurationSubscriber
 
Can we use Publish and Subscribe?

MessagePublications? - is this name correct - consistency, e.g. MessagePublicationRoutes?
Why not have an IEnumerable of MessagePublication?
Why not have ExchangeConfiguration instead of MessageDelivery
MessageConsumer - Why is ExchangeName in ctor, why part of transient queue name, what if used by non-transient queue?

Why extra layer for logging?
why not use standard dir for disconnected messages - no need for check.require in bus ctor

Publisher
Why get rid of multiple publishers
Why have a single channel per thread that is long lived, use + dispose?


Publisher - Sync
What if confirmed is false?
	Should we retry?
	Should we store these messages to disk otherwise they will get lost
Application exception message should contain message info.
