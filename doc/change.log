Reverted to just using log4net for logging
	log4net now includes a ILog interface
	Got rid of all Common.Logging interfaces

Updated reference assembly versions
	log4net				1.2.12		2.0.3 (1.2.13)
	Newtonsoft.Json		6.0.1		6.0.8
	NSubstitute			1.6.1		1.8.1
	Nunit				2.6.2		2.6.4
	RabbitMQ			3.3.4		3.4.3

	I manually added these changes, used nuget install to pull down, and then manually placed assemblies in the lib directory
	I have now updated to use nuget - hence the package.config files in each of the projects - NUnit.Runners is taken care of by the build scripts
	
Added nuget package management creation to build scripts
	
Testing issues
	Why does the test run take so long to complete 
		On mono have narrowed this down to issues with PublisherSpec

RabbitMQ 3.4 recovery options
	Have left as defaulted to not do recovery for now as this is a very like what the connection manager in this library does
